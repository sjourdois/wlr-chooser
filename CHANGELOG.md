## 1.1.0

### Added

- **Live thumbnails**: previews now refresh continuously (damage-driven), so the
  grid shows windows updating in real time, including on other workspaces.
- **GPU zero-copy capture** behind the `gpu` Cargo feature (on by default):
  dma-bufs are allocated via gbm and imported as GL textures (EGLImage), with no
  CPU read-back. Falls back to the CPU shm path automatically when unavailable.
  Build without it (no gbm/`libgbm` dependency) via `--no-default-features`.
- **`--switch`** window switcher: a live alt-tab / exposé that **focuses** the
  picked window (via `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1`) instead of printing.
  Two presentations via `--layout`: `full` (full-screen mission-control grid that
  dims the desktop, with an intro animation — default) or `compact` (the centred
  card). Identical windows are disambiguated by creation order so the right one
  is focused. Only one switcher opens at a time (re-pressing the keybind is a
  no-op, via a single-instance lock).

## 1.0.0
